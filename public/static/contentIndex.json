They then have to jump to a rooftop slong side the train line. You get the idea you have to do an arry of tasks to prove you have what it takes.\nTraning\nthey are told that there is a new rule that the lowest preforming puples of the class will become factionless. when she was put in a ring with a pure dauntless she had other quality of the other factions as she is a divergent meaning quality of a range of factions. Like empathy which stops her from putting in her all to defeat her opponent. at the tatto parla she see the person who tested her and knows shes a divergent see her agin gives her newly found confidence and trains harder than before. 4 the trainer starts to show a nicer side of his personality giving tips and showing he may be more than a dauntless war machine.\nWar games\nshe runs from the infermory to the train on the way to the war games 4‚Äôs first choice as a captain is the protagnest as he see she has other quaitys other than being a grunt like the full dauntles‚Äôs.\nshe shows one of these quaity in climbing to have a look out this shows her smarts. this allows her team to win the war game.\nParents divergent\nthis scene shows family relationships being broken or provoked as she is different compared to the others that are pure one faction. They fell intimidated of whom that can have many character defining traits.\nThe erudite trying to rule the government\nthe erudite are try to take place of the abnegation. As they have been trying and trying to dehumanise everyone and turn them against human nature so that they have a dependence on them. Becuse the way an evil can build control through dependence.\nPropaganda at work\nbecause of the fear caused by becoming factionless, this fear is induced by the dependence of the status to live a meaningful life according to the propaganda. When kids have this values instilled apon them from birth, these values often last life times as a kid cannot make their own disistions for them selfs.\n4 &amp; protagonist go for a trip\n4 and the protagonist go for a trip together. Shows the protagonist how to blend in to how a dauntless would do things to avoid being caught. Becuse she has the traits of other factions, she could easily be caught if they see she‚Äôs using these skills she shouldn‚Äôt have.\n4\n4 is a divergent just like the protagonist by learning the morals of each faction. He shows his back which has every faction on it, showing he wants to earn the traits of each.\nFinal test\nthe final test is important becuse she has to fight her fares fast and without susption of her being a divergent. her being sexualy abused was in that final test with the love interest of the protagnest. she also had to kill a meber of her family duing the scene\nThe serum\nthey all got injected with a transplant after that controls them so they have formed a mindless army. the protagonist has to try her best to blend in as the transplant didn‚Äôt work. she find 4 who is also just blending in as he is also now a divergent\ngeting caught\nthey get singled out, and they are tested buy a gun almost being shot at 4 head. they got caught by trris holding a gun to there heads ot them caught then the mum free them. they fight back as they are being chaced by meny mindless drones of humans. the mum dies as they cross a wide open road.\nControlling system\nthey have a control system inside the dauntless base. She sees 4 who has been taken over. She breaks the mind control by using love, just like a classic movie love tale. Furthermore, she then holds the leader of erudite, who is controlling everyone. They then made her shutdown the system now everyone is free again but the leaders of the dauntless have the same thoughts as the erudite.\nThemes at the end of the film\nfamily relationships\nfamily relationships are tested and people are lost. Both the dad and mum of Betris (protagonist) die while fighting for the betterment of the city. This is true of jojo rabit (movie) and the sniper where they all have an immediate family member die due to a conflict. In the text the sniper, it was a political civil war. These all have propaganda at their core to cause the conflict.\nwar is damaging\noThis film shows how war/conflicts can be damaging, hurting and often unnecessary homicide or mass genocide. This links into family relationships as this is the result of this damage.

Dublin lay enveloped in darkness but for the dim light of the moon that shone through fleecy clouds, casting a pale light as of approaching dawn over the streets and the dark waters of the Liffey. Around the beleaguered Four Courts the heavy guns roared. Here and there through the city, machine guns and rifles broke the silence of the night, spasmodically, like dogs barking on lone farms. Republicans and Free Staters were waging civil war.\nOn a rooftop near O‚ÄôConnell Bridge, a Republican sniper lay watching. Beside him lay his rifle and over his shoulders was slung a pair of field glasses. His face was the face of a student, thin and ascetic, but his eyes had the cold gleam of the fanatic. They were deep and thoughtful, the eyes of a man who is used to looking at death.\nHe was eating a sandwich hungrily. He had eaten nothing since morning. He had been too excited to eat. He finished the sandwich, and, taking a flask of whisky from his pocket, he took a short drought. Then he returned the flask to his pocket. He paused for a moment, considering whether he should risk a smoke. It was dangerous. The flash might be seen in the darkness, and there were enemies watching. He decided to take the risk.\nPlacing a cigarette between his lips, he struck a match, inhaled the smoke hurriedly and put out the light. Almost immediately, a bullet flattened itself against the parapet of the roof. The sniper took another whiff and put out the cigarette. Then he swore softly and crawled away to the left.\nCautiously he raised himself and peered over the parapet. There was a flash and a bullet whizzed over his head. He dropped immediately. He had seen the flash. It came from the opposite side of the street.\nHe rolled over the roof to a chimney stack in the rear, and slowly drew himself up behind it, until his eyes were level with the top of the parapet. There was nothing to be seen‚Äîjust the dim outline of the opposite housetop against the blue sky. His enemy was under cover.\nJust then an armored car came across the bridge and advanced slowly up the street. It stopped on the opposite side of the street, fifty yards ahead. The sniper could hear the dull panting of the motor. His heart beat faster. It was an enemy car. He wanted to fire, but he knew it was useless. His bullets would never pierce the steel that covered the gray monster.\nThen round the corner of a side street came an old woman, her head covered by a tattered shawl. She began to talk to the man in the turret of the car. She was pointing to the roof where the sniper lay. An informer.\nThe turret opened. A man‚Äôs head and shoulders appeared, looking toward the sniper. The sniper raised his rifle and fired. The head fell heavily on the turret wall. The woman darted toward the side street. The sniper fired again. The woman whirled round and fell with a shriek into the gutter.\nSuddenly from the opposite roof a shot rang out and the sniper dropped his rifle with a curse. The rifle clattered to the roof. The sniper thought the noise would wake the dead. He stooped to pick the rifle up. He couldn‚Äôt lift it. His forearm was dead. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hit,‚Äù he muttered.\nDropping flat onto the roof, he crawled back to the parapet. With his left hand he felt the injured right forearm. The blood was oozing through the sleeve of his coat. There was no pain‚Äîjust a deadened sensation, as if the arm had been cut off.\nQuickly he drew his knife from his pocket, opened it on the breastwork of the parapet, and ripped open the sleeve. There was a small hole where the bullet had entered. On the other side there was no hole. The bullet had lodged in the bone. It must have fractured it. He bent the arm below the wound. The arm bent back easily. He ground his teeth to overcome the pain.\nThen taking out his field dressing, he ripped open the packet with his knife. He broke the neck of the iodine bottle and let the bitter fluid drip into the wound. A paroxysm of pain swept through him. He placed the cotton wadding over the wound and wrapped the dressing over it. He tied the ends with his teeth.\nThen he lay still against the parapet, and, closing his eyes, he made an effort of will to overcome the pain.\nIn the street beneath all was still. The armored car had retired speedily over the bridge, with the machine gunner‚Äôs head hanging lifeless over the turret. The woman‚Äôs corpse lay still in the gutter.\nThe sniper lay still for a long time nursing his wounded arm and planning escape. Morning must not find him wounded on the roof. The enemy on the opposite roof covered his escape. He must kill that enemy and he could not use his rifle. He had only a revolver to do it. Then he thought of a plan.\nTaking off his cap, he placed it over the muzzle of his rifle. Then he pushed the rifle slowly upward over the parapet, until the cap was visible from the opposite side of the street. Almost immediately there was a report, and a bullet pierced the center of the cap. The sniper slanted the rifle forward. The cap clipped down into the street. Then catching the rifle in the middle, the sniper dropped his left hand over the roof and let it hang, lifelessly. After a few moments he let the rifle drop to the street. Then he sank to the roof, dragging his hand with him.\nCrawling quickly to his feet, he peered up at the corner of the roof. His ruse had succeeded. The other sniper, seeing the cap and rifle fall, thought that he had killed his man. He was now standing before a row of chimney pots, looking across, with his head clearly silhouetted against the western sky.\nThe Republican sniper smiled and lifted his revolver above the edge of the parapet. The distance was about fifty yards‚Äîa hard shot in the dim light, and his right arm was paining him like a thousand devils. He took a steady aim. His hand trembled with eagerness. Pressing his lips together, he took a deep breath through his nostrils and fired. He was almost deafened with the report and his arm shook with the recoil.\nThen when the smoke cleared, he peered across and uttered a cry of joy. His enemy had been hit. He was reeling over the parapet in his death agony. He struggled to keep his feet, but he was slowly falling forward as if in a dream. The rifle fell from his grasp, hit the parapet, fell over, bounded off the pole of a barber‚Äôs shop beneath and then clattered on the pavement.\nThen the dying man on the roof crumpled up and fell forward. The body turned over and over in space and hit the ground with a dull thud. Then it lay still.\nThe sniper looked at his enemy falling and he shuddered. The lust of battle died in him. He became bitten by remorse. The sweat stood out in beads on his forehead. Weakened by his wound and the long summer day of fasting and watching on the roof, he revolted from the sight of the shattered mass of his dead enemy. His teeth chattered, he began to gibber to himself, cursing the war, cursing himself, cursing everybody.\nHe looked at the smoking revolver in his hand, and with an oath he hurled it to the roof at his feet. The revolver went off with a concussion and the bullet whizzed past the sniper‚Äôs head. He was frightened back to his senses by the shock. His nerves steadied. The cloud of fear scattered from his mind and he laughed.\nTaking the whiskey flask from his pocket, he emptied it a drought. He felt reckless under the influence of the spirit. He decided to leave the roof now and look for his company commander, to report. Everywhere around was quiet. There was not much danger in going through the streets. He picked up his revolver and put it in his pocket. Then he crawled down through the skylight to the house underneath.\nWhen the sniper reached the laneway on the street level, he felt a sudden curiosity as to the identity of the enemy sniper whom he had killed. He decided that he was a good shot, whoever he was. He wondered did he know him. Perhaps he had been in his own company before the split in the army. He decided to risk going over to have a look at him. He peered around the corner into O‚ÄôConnell Street. In the upper part of the street there was heavy firing, but around here all was quiet.\nThe sniper darted across the street. A machine gun tore up the ground around him with a hail of bullets, but he escaped. He threw himself face downward beside the corpse. The machine gun stopped.\nThen the sniper turned over the dead body and looked into his brother‚Äôs face."}}
