To enable the sharing of these through share links. A final goal of a full Stack app more than just a API having a fleshed out user experience/user interface.\nProblem, issue, interest or opportunity that is being addressed\nThe Current way of sharing notes in school especially in science classes. where google sites are widely used in the department for note taking and sharing. Google sites has a old user interface using a proprietary standards standards. With our application well use open standards like markdown that can be edited by a large array of applications.\nEnd Users\nAn example end user would be a student. A student could make a Homework document then upload it and get it check by a teacher. I use a similar service Quartz a static site generator for markdown notes. That i use for school like one of our targret end user would use it as.\nKey Resources\nServer resources for hosting the API application. That facilitates the Upload and the management of these documents e.g. the viewing, archiving or deleting of notes. A front end client that interfaces with the documents through the API to preform actions mentioned above.\nKey Project Components\nAPI server using poem and poem-openapi less established but stable with auto API documentation using the OpenApi standard . API client using either leptos a rust front end framework with a well establish surrounding ecosystem. Plus using tailwind for styling for components. For a data base well run Postgres database a well established database in the industry.\nMy Responsibilities\nManage the Git Repository checking best practices along with the rest of the team. Data base development and infrastructure. Primary infrastructure/DevOps engineer. Plus integration into the API.\nMinimum Viable Product (MVP) Specs\nA asynchronous API built in rust to Upload, delete and request the documents stored in a database. On top of this well build a simple user interface to facilitate these actions.\n\n Teacher has checked and approved this project proposal\n\nDate: 15/5/24"},"7DIT/7DIT-Major-Project-Portfolio/Handing-in-your-project":{"title":"Handing in your project","links":["7DIT/7DIT-Major-Project-Portfolio/Assessment-Information"],"tags":["7dit","dit","dit-28","dit-23"],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  Important\n                  \n                \nUse this checklist to ensure you have met key task requirements before handing in your project\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Important\n                  \n                \nOnce you have completed everything in this checklist, you are ready to hand in your work.

The exact time and date will be communicated closer to the time, and is subject to change.\n\nAssessment Details\nYou will be assessed on\n\nhow effectively you use project management tools and techniques to plan and manage the development of a digital outcome\nhow effectively you decompose the problem into smaller components, and test and refine your digital outcome so that it is a high-quality project\nhow well you have addressed relevant implications\nhow well you synthesise information from the planning, testing and trialling of components to develop a high-quality outcome\n\nProject Selection\nIn consultation with your teacher, you will identify a suitable digital technologies project to work on. You have significant choice in what your project will be, and this is a deliberate decision to allow you to explore an area of interest. Throughout the project, you must make use of advanced processes as outlined in AS91897 - Use advanced processes to develop a digital technologies outcome. This includes the use of project management tools and techniques which are outlined below.\nProject management tools and techniques\nExamples include:\n\nsaving backup copies with a logical file naming system\nusing collaboration tools\nusing simple version control software applications\nusing tools or systems to plan tasks and milestones\nadjusting key actions and tasks where appropriate\n\nA guide that outlines how to use Github to support this project is available here:\nGithub Guide\nDocumenting Your Project\nAs you work through your project, it is important to document your progress.

This must clearly show the work that has been done by each team member, and how individuals have applied project management tools and techniques.\n\nNotion Portfolio Documentation\nThree separate Sprint pages have been created for you and linked from the portfolio dashboard. These pages contain a number of sections for you to fill in as you work. You are encouraged to modify these pages to suit your project if necessary.\n\n\nSprint Planning: What you are aiming to achieve in the next sprint\n\n\nDay to day development log: Ongoing notes regarding project development, trialling and testing\n\n\nSprint Retrospective: Share your latest release and gather feedback\n\n\nSprint Review: Review your progress from the last sprint, and use this to inform planning for next sprint\n\n\nFinal release\n\nA separate Notion page has been set up for your final release notes and documentation. This should include a discussion of how information gained from planning, testing and trialling project components has led to the development of a high quality digital technologies outcome.\n\nGithub Repo / Project Documentation\n\n\nYour Github repository will contain your project files along with evidence of your ongoing code commits. Formal releases will be completed at the end of each sprint.\n\n\nYour Github project board will be used to plan and track each sprint. You should take screenshots of your project board at various stages throughout your project. This will help to demonstrate how you have implemented relevant project management techniques.\n\n\nAdditional Assessment\nDepending on the nature and content of your project, it may be possible to meet the requirements of additional Achievement Standards. Your focus should be on developing a really interesting and meaningful project. Additional assessments should be considered a bonus.

I have decided against the use of sled sue to the complexity involved in creating a high availability deployment of it. this is due to inherit flaws of file systems; you would have overwrites and file conflicts if you had a high flow of traffic asynchronously writing to the same file system.\nWhat Is The Savor\nCloud Native PG a cloud native PostgreSQL database. It Drastically simplify the deployment of PostgreSQL on kubernetes it also implements many standards found in normal PostgreSQL clusters. I does this by being a custom kubernetes controller written in my teachers current favorite language Go-lang.

I then made a Order struct to hold the order and add to the order. The order struck also implements display so it can be printed normally with cool formatting.\nToday\nI intend in get the user input started and add methods to the order struct to calculate the profits, gross sales.\nWhat i actually got done… I have refactored the formatting for how all structs are prints, both Order and Food structs. Also have made a struct to allow the easy printing of a vector array of Order struct objects. The start I have made on CLI is very Early and has no compensation for false inputs. Among all this, I found a FLAW.\nThe Flaw\nI have not accounted for, the face that people would like more than one of an item. I haven’t made a quantities counter. My remedy to this is since the program’s main purpose as I set out below is for a calculator to display profit and cost not quantities as an output, so I will be able to avoid this issue.

The story follows a teenager who hacks his way in too highly secure systems over the course of the book. Homeland security finally catches up with him landing himself in a youth detention center for his crimes. This story shows you the disconnect between his actions and the world around him. The reproductions of his action felt disconnected because he wasn’t directly involved like a robbery.\nQuote 1 need atention\nThis quote showed me the weight of the story &quot;He was actually just trying to score a new computer and some other cool stuff, and in any case the words &quot;to its knees&quot; were the New York Times&#039; not his.&quot;. This quote\nQuote 2 good\nA big moment in the story was &quot;At exactly 8.59 am, as Sam Wilson was walking through the main entrance to his school, nodding to the security guards-who ignored him - and smiling at their aggressive- looking guard dogs which snarled at him, a series of catastrophes was striking the largest telecommunications company in America: Telecomerica.&quot; This quote made me think of the systems i use. What would be the impact if a similar event happen you would be none the wiser of who did it. It could be your friend your neighbor. It demonstrates how faceless cyber crime can be. Sometimes I see a criminal hacker get arrested they look no different than any other computer geek. who in society we have assigned a stereotype of being harmless the truth is they are not."},"7ENF/BrainJack-Chapters/1.-Dirty-Tricks":{"title":"1.

As they have been trying and trying to dehumanise everyone and turn them against human nature so that they have a dependence on them. Becuse the way an evil can build control through dependence.\nPropaganda at work\nbecause of the fear caused by becoming factionless, this fear is induced by the dependence of the status to live a meaningful life according to the propaganda. When kids have this values instilled apon them from birth, these values often last life times as a kid cannot make their own disistions for them selfs.\n4 &amp; protagonist go for a trip\n4 and the protagonist go for a trip together.

Both the dad and mum of Betris (protagonist) die while fighting for the betterment of the city. This is true of jojo rabit (movie) and the sniper where they all have an immediate family member die due to a conflict. In the text the sniper, it was a political civil war. These all have propaganda at their core to cause the conflict.\nwar is damaging\noThis film shows how war/conflicts can be damaging, hurting and often unnecessary homicide or mass genocide. This links into family relationships as this is the result of this damage. War causes families to turn on themselves or even kill each other, that’s in the case of the sniper he kills his brother unknowingly. Genocide applys quite well to the intent of the erudite the intelgens of the cosiety wanted to put themself in power. they had thought that the only way was to wipe out the law makers of the city causing a genocide.✍️\nTransclude of factions"},"factions":{"title":"factions","links":[],"tags":["6enf","movie","divergent"],"content":"candor\nhonest \n\ndauntless\nthe brave\n\nerudite\nintelgence\n\namity\nkind \n\nAbnegation\nselfless\n"},"index":{"title":"Home Of Liam's Notes","links":[],"tags":["6enf","6sce","bio","chem","dit","6dit","7phx","7enf","7dit","7che"],"content":"WOW I Am Sooooooo Good At School Check Out My 10/10 Cheat Codes !!!\nThey work most if not none of the time 👍👍👍"},"kubernetes":{"title":"kubernetes","links":[],"tags":["dit"],"content":"How I Use kubernetes\nI use kubernetes mostly in my CD pipeline I also have deployed other servieces like bitwarden a password manager too.\nContinuous Deployment (CD)\nThe main service that makes continuous deployment work for me is ArgoCd.

Dublin lay enveloped in darkness but for the dim light of the moon that shone through fleecy clouds, casting a pale light as of approaching dawn over the streets and the dark waters of the Liffey. Around the beleaguered Four Courts the heavy guns roared. Here and there through the city, machine guns and rifles broke the silence of the night, spasmodically, like dogs barking on lone farms. Republicans and Free Staters were waging civil war.\nOn a rooftop near O’Connell Bridge, a Republican sniper lay watching. Beside him lay his rifle and over his shoulders was slung a pair of field glasses. His face was the face of a student, thin and ascetic, but his eyes had the cold gleam of the fanatic. They were deep and thoughtful, the eyes of a man who is used to looking at death.\nHe was eating a sandwich hungrily. He had eaten nothing since morning. He had been too excited to eat. He finished the sandwich, and, taking a flask of whisky from his pocket, he took a short drought. Then he returned the flask to his pocket. He paused for a moment, considering whether he should risk a smoke. It was dangerous. The flash might be seen in the darkness, and there were enemies watching. He decided to take the risk.\nPlacing a cigarette between his lips, he struck a match, inhaled the smoke hurriedly and put out the light. Almost immediately, a bullet flattened itself against the parapet of the roof. The sniper took another whiff and put out the cigarette. Then he swore softly and crawled away to the left.\nCautiously he raised himself and peered over the parapet. There was a flash and a bullet whizzed over his head. He dropped immediately. He had seen the flash. It came from the opposite side of the street.\nHe rolled over the roof to a chimney stack in the rear, and slowly drew himself up behind it, until his eyes were level with the top of the parapet. There was nothing to be seen—just the dim outline of the opposite housetop against the blue sky. His enemy was under cover.\nJust then an armored car came across the bridge and advanced slowly up the street. It stopped on the opposite side of the street, fifty yards ahead. The sniper could hear the dull panting of the motor. His heart beat faster. It was an enemy car. He wanted to fire, but he knew it was useless. His bullets would never pierce the steel that covered the gray monster.\nThen round the corner of a side street came an old woman, her head covered by a tattered shawl. She began to talk to the man in the turret of the car. She was pointing to the roof where the sniper lay. An informer.\nThe turret opened. A man’s head and shoulders appeared, looking toward the sniper. The sniper raised his rifle and fired. The head fell heavily on the turret wall. The woman darted toward the side street. The sniper fired again. The woman whirled round and fell with a shriek into the gutter.\nSuddenly from the opposite roof a shot rang out and the sniper dropped his rifle with a curse. The rifle clattered to the roof. The sniper thought the noise would wake the dead. He stooped to pick the rifle up. He couldn’t lift it. His forearm was dead. “I’m hit,” he muttered.\nDropping flat onto the roof, he crawled back to the parapet. With his left hand he felt the injured right forearm. The blood was oozing through the sleeve of his coat. There was no pain—just a deadened sensation, as if the arm had been cut off.\nQuickly he drew his knife from his pocket, opened it on the breastwork of the parapet, and ripped open the sleeve. There was a small hole where the bullet had entered. On the other side there was no hole. The bullet had lodged in the bone. It must have fractured it. He bent the arm below the wound. The arm bent back easily. He ground his teeth to overcome the pain.\nThen taking out his field dressing, he ripped open the packet with his knife. He broke the neck of the iodine bottle and let the bitter fluid drip into the wound. A paroxysm of pain swept through him. He placed the cotton wadding over the wound and wrapped the dressing over it. He tied the ends with his teeth.\nThen he lay still against the parapet, and, closing his eyes, he made an effort of will to overcome the pain.\nIn the street beneath all was still. The armored car had retired speedily over the bridge, with the machine gunner’s head hanging lifeless over the turret. The woman’s corpse lay still in the gutter.\nThe sniper lay still for a long time nursing his wounded arm and planning escape. Morning must not find him wounded on the roof. The enemy on the opposite roof covered his escape. He must kill that enemy and he could not use his rifle. He had only a revolver to do it. Then he thought of a plan.\nTaking off his cap, he placed it over the muzzle of his rifle. Then he pushed the rifle slowly upward over the parapet, until the cap was visible from the opposite side of the street. Almost immediately there was a report, and a bullet pierced the center of the cap. The sniper slanted the rifle forward. The cap clipped down into the street. Then catching the rifle in the middle, the sniper dropped his left hand over the roof and let it hang, lifelessly. After a few moments he let the rifle drop to the street. Then he sank to the roof, dragging his hand with him.\nCrawling quickly to his feet, he peered up at the corner of the roof. His ruse had succeeded. The other sniper, seeing the cap and rifle fall, thought that he had killed his man. He was now standing before a row of chimney pots, looking across, with his head clearly silhouetted against the western sky.\nThe Republican sniper smiled and lifted his revolver above the edge of the parapet. The distance was about fifty yards—a hard shot in the dim light, and his right arm was paining him like a thousand devils. He took a steady aim. His hand trembled with eagerness. Pressing his lips together, he took a deep breath through his nostrils and fired. He was almost deafened with the report and his arm shook with the recoil.\nThen when the smoke cleared, he peered across and uttered a cry of joy. His enemy had been hit. He was reeling over the parapet in his death agony. He struggled to keep his feet, but he was slowly falling forward as if in a dream. The rifle fell from his grasp, hit the parapet, fell over, bounded off the pole of a barber’s shop beneath and then clattered on the pavement.\nThen the dying man on the roof crumpled up and fell forward. The body turned over and over in space and hit the ground with a dull thud. Then it lay still.\nThe sniper looked at his enemy falling and he shuddered. The lust of battle died in him. He became bitten by remorse. The sweat stood out in beads on his forehead. Weakened by his wound and the long summer day of fasting and watching on the roof, he revolted from the sight of the shattered mass of his dead enemy. His teeth chattered, he began to gibber to himself, cursing the war, cursing himself, cursing everybody.\nHe looked at the smoking revolver in his hand, and with an oath he hurled it to the roof at his feet. The revolver went off with a concussion and the bullet whizzed past the sniper’s head. He was frightened back to his senses by the shock. His nerves steadied. The cloud of fear scattered from his mind and he laughed.\nTaking the whiskey flask from his pocket, he emptied it a drought. He felt reckless under the influence of the spirit. He decided to leave the roof now and look for his company commander, to report. Everywhere around was quiet. There was not much danger in going through the streets. He picked up his revolver and put it in his pocket. Then he crawled down through the skylight to the house underneath.\nWhen the sniper reached the laneway on the street level, he felt a sudden curiosity as to the identity of the enemy sniper whom he had killed. He decided that he was a good shot, whoever he was. He wondered did he know him. Perhaps he had been in his own company before the split in the army. He decided to risk going over to have a look at him. He peered around the corner into O’Connell Street. In the upper part of the street there was heavy firing, but around here all was quiet.\nThe sniper darted across the street. A machine gun tore up the ground around him with a hail of bullets, but he escaped. He threw himself face downward beside the corpse. The machine gun stopped.\nThen the sniper turned over the dead body and looked into his brother’s face."}}
